# SmartCity-Arduino üèô

This project treats the development of an IoT smart city using Arduino. The smart city will be equipped with the following functionalities:
- Smart lighting;
- Smart parking lots;
- Air quality monitoring;
- Flood management;
- Waste bucket management;

Each feature will be explained in the dedicated sections.

## Materials used in the project üìù
- Box:
  - 4mm thick plywood (1m x 1m);
  - 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar (3.2m);
  - Gray acrylic spray;

- Parking:
  - 6 IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module;
  - 2 Light Sensor (Photoresistor);
  - 2 Resistor 10k ohm;
  - 2 KY-008 Laser Module;
  - 1 Servo micro TowerPro sg90 9g;
  - 1 8x8 Dot Led Matrix Module;

## STEPS
## Step 1: Box creation
<p align="center"><img src="./images/box_image.jpg"/></p>
Two steps were performed to create the box. For the bottom base (left in photo), a 40cm x 40cm square was cut out and 5cm high sides applied. To make the structure more solid, pieces of the 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar were cut out and applied in the corners. Fastening was done with wood glue and tacks. For the upper base (right in the photo), a 43cm x 43cm square was cut out, applying the sides and the 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar so that it would fit with the bottom base.
Finally, we painted the entire base with gray acrylic spray.
