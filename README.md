# SmartCity-Arduino üèô

This project treats the development of an IoT smart city using Arduino. The smart city will be equipped with the following functionalities:
- Smart lighting;
- Smart parking lots;
- Air quality monitoring;
- Flood management;
- Waste bucket management;

Each feature will be explained in the dedicated sections.

## Getting started üöÄ
### 1. Install MQTT broker
Installed the MQTT broker and we modify the file ```mosquitto.conf``` inserting the following lines to allow remote access:
```
listener 1885
allow_anonymous true
```
### 2. Install Node-RED
- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/);
- To ensure the correct installation run in the terminal:
```
node --version && npm ‚Äìversion
```
- Install Node-RED using: 
```
npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```
- Execute:
```
node-red
```
- Now you can access to ```http://localhost:1880``` and you need to install the ```node-red-dashboard``` palette. 


## Materials used in the project üìù
- Box:
  - 4mm thick plywood (1m x 1m);
  - 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar (3.2m);
  - Gray acrylic spray;

- Smart Parking:
  - IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module (6x);
  - Light Sensor (Photoresistor) (2x);
  - Resistor 10k ohm (2x);
  - KY-008 Laser Module (2x);
  - Servo micro TowerPro sg90 9g;
  - 8x8 Dot Led Matrix Module;
  
 - Smart Lighting:
  - Light Sensor (Photoresistor);
  - Resistor 10k ohm;
  - Resistor 220 ohm (4x);
  - LED 5mm (4x);

## STEPS
## Step 1: Box creation
<p align="center"><img src="./images/box_image.jpg"/></p>
Two steps were performed to create the box. For the bottom base (left in photo), a 40cm x 40cm square was cut out and 5cm high sides applied. To make the structure more solid, pieces of the 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar were cut out and applied in the corners. Fastening was done with wood glue and tacks. For the upper base (right in the photo), a 43cm x 43cm square was cut out, applying the sides and the 1.5cm x 1.5cm bar so that it would fit with the bottom base.
Finally, we painted the entire base with gray acrylic spray.


## Step 2: Smart Parking wiring and code
The various connections for building the smart parking lot have been divided for illustration purposes only. The first image shows the components needed to detect the presence of a car in each lot. The second image shows the components needed for entry and exit in the parking lot equipped with a bar and how available and occupied spaces are shown.
